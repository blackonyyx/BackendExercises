To pass configurations from the subchart to the deployment , we first need to identify the environment variables from the dependency chart itself. 
This can be found from the values.yaml file of the dependency, or through documentation
Then we access the value through eg {{.Values.postgresql.service.host}} or a helm function like toYaml/toJson
